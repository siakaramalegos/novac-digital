# Novac Digital Film Archive

developed by [Sia Karamalegos](https://github.com/siakaramalegos)

*An application to help the [New Orleans Video Access Club](http://www.novacvideo.org/) (NOVAC) digitize their film library and manage current film projects*

If you are contributing to this app, after pulling down the code, bundling, and migrating, you can also run a `rake db:populate` command to generate fake data in development.  You will also need to register and potentially manually change your user account to be an admin account via the command line.
